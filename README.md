Repo for our CS 4704 at Virginia Tech Senior Design Project: Ryde


Ryde is a mobile application that facilitates Greek life in delivering their designated driver service.  Upon launching the application, the user can log into their organizationâ€™s group to access the list of designated drivers for the night.  The user can request a ride with a few simple clicks, and Ryde will automatically keep track of the passenger queue for the drivers.  Ryde will keep track of the location of the needed pickup, and the number of people in that specified pickup. When the driver is available the driver selects the next passenger in the queue and the riders are notified that the driver is on the way. This substantially cuts down on distracted driving and allows the driver to focus on the road. When the driver arrives for the passenger, the passenger is notified and removed from the list of rides.
